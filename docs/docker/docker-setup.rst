============
sproof-api-client
============

This module provides an API for registering, revoking and verifying data
with an existing sproof account.

Start
============

1. Create a premium account
------------

Create a account on https://app.sproof.io.

2. Get the sproof-client-api
------------

``git clone https://gitlab.com/sproof/sproof-api-client.git``

3. Create config and theme
------------

Copy the ``exampleTheme.js`` and ``exampleConfig.js`` to ``theme.js``
and ``config.js``.

Add your sproof code to ``data/config.js`` You can download your sproof
code in the settings page.

For production change the chainId from ``3`` to ``1``. Please note, that
the chainId 1 is the mainnet. Before you can use sproof on the mainnet
you will need to choose a plan on the web app.

4. Modify the verifier theme
------------

You will find a ``exampleTheme.js`` file in the ``data`` folder. You can
adjust colors and buttons styles. Save it under ``theme.js``

5. Modify the text of the verifier
------------

You will find the files ``exampleEn.js`` and ``exampleDe.js`` in the
``data`` folder. Save them under ``en.js`` and ``de.js`` to adjust the
translations.

Run
============

Run:

``docker-compose up --build``

to start this module. It will create a API and host the verifier theme
on port 6001. The docker file will build the web verifier only on the
first start, to be sure to add ``--build`` if you change the theme.

By default it will not rebuild the UI. If you want to rebuild the UI, so
that it uses your custom theme you need to uncomment the line

``command: sh ./scripts/buildUIAndStart.sh``

in the docker-compose file.

Access code
=============

The access code is a token, which secures your API endpoint. It will be
generated and stored under ``data/accessCode.json`` and logged. This
accessCode is necessery to send external API requests to the sproof
client.

Visit
https://sproof-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docker/docker-api.html for
the documentation for the API endpoint.
